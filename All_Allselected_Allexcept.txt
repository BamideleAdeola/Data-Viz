Understanding #All, #Allselected and #Allexcept #DAX #Function

As a PowerBI developer or data specialist, you need to understand row and filter context.
#ALL - Return the table or column with filters removed.
#ALLSELECTED- Returns all the rows in a table or all the values in a column, ignoring any filters which might have been applied on the columns or the rows but keeping all other explicit filters.
#ALLEXCEPT- Removes all context filters in the table except filters that have been applied to the specified columns.

ALL - Returned a total of 1,924,337.88 even when Central, East and South were selected or filtered. This implies that filtered were totally removed.
ALLSELECTED -  Returned a total of 1,397,561.31 for the 3 selections. This only summed up to the 3 selected Regions.
ALLEXCEPT - Removed other filters except filter on Region based on the measure.
