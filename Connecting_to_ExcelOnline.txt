#Connecting to #Excel #Online or on SharePoint

Did you have your excel data on a #SharePoint or #OneDrive? 
Do you know storing your excel data on a SharePoint site or OneDrive makes the excel file a cloud storage?
Hence, what is the best approach to pulling excel file on SharePoint into power bi? 

Here are the steps: 
1. Open the excel file from SharePoint in desktop app
2. Copy the file path (click file>info>copy path)
3. On power bi use web data source
4. Paste the url and delete ?web=1 from the url.
5. Click ok and sleuth your data

You can schedule refresh on Power Bi service automatically without refreshing the data on the power bi desktop and it picks any update because you are now dealing with a cloud data source.
