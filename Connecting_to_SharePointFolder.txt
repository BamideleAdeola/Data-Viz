#Connecting PowerBI to #SharePoint Folder

At times, you might have a document that comes in monthly saved in a sharepoint folder. 
While there are several ways to access the contents of a folder, I find using SharePoint.Contents very useful.

Follow these steps: 
1. Copy the site Url of the SharePoint List. (You can just copy the logo at the top left of the SharePoint List)
2. Connect to SharePoint Folder from Power BI Get Data and Paste the site url
4. Authenticate with your Microsoft Account if it is your first time connecting.
5. You can change the SharePoint.Files function to SharePoint.Contents
6. Expand Shared Folder table

SharePoint is a cloud data source, hence one can schedule refresh automatically.
Have you connected to SharePoint as a datasource before? If yes, did you do anything differently? 
If you find it useful, kindly #follow, #like, #share and #comment.
