#Connecting PowerBI to #SharePoint List

Ever connected to a SharePoint List as a data source in #Power BI? 
Yes, I do that very often seeing that some cool power apps application I have seen had SharePoint List as their data source. 
This post is to help those willing to connect SharePoint List to Power BI.

Follow these steps: 
1. Copy the site Url of the SharePoint List. (You can just copy the logo at the top left of the SharePoint List)
2. Search for SharePoint Online on Power BI Get data
3. Paste the site url
4. Authenticate with your Microsoft Account.
5. Navigate to your SharePoint List

SharePoint is a cloud data source, hence one can schedule refresh automatically.
Have you connected to SharePoint as a datasource before? If yes, did you do anything differently?
