#Field Conditional #formating with #SWITCH TRUE function
A field conditional formatting allows you to use another column to format the content of another column. 
Assuming we intend to use the content of a background colour created with a SWITCH TRUE Function, we can use field (column) conditional formatting to achieve this 

Here is the code for the colour column for those that missed it.
Status Colour Code = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
[Deal_Status] = "Ongoing", "#CEB629",           //  Yellow/Amber
[Deal_Status] = "Closed Won", "#51B74B",        // Green
[Deal_Status] = "Closed Lost",  "#E04646",      // Red
[Deal_Status] = "Deprioritized", "#B3B3B3"      // Grey
)

In this example, I created a table with account_name and Deal_status. 
The intention is to format deal status background with the Status_Colour_Code I created based on my business case.
