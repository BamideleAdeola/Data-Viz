#Conditional #formatting based on #string #fields (#PowerBI #February 2022 update)

Much awaited conditional formatting based on string fields is out. Instead of writing a SWITCH TRUE function to get my colour codes, 
I can just do a conditional formatting directly based on the field.

Looking forward to your comment on this.

Also note that the data is a fictitious data.
