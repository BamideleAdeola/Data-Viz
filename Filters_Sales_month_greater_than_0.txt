Calculating #Sales for #Profitable Months

The first step to writing a good measure is understanding the request and knowing what #DAX #Function to use.

Imagine you have the intention to calculate sales, but only for months that have achieved a profit and those that achieved a loss separately.

Some restrictions of Boolean expression when used as a filter arguments are: 
a. You can't reference columns from multiple tables
b. A measure can't be referenced
c. Using a nested Calculate function is not possible
d. You can't use a functions that scan or return a table

Hence, table expression is best suitable for more complex filter requirements such as Calculating Sales for Profitable Months. 
This is because one needs to evaluate the profit measure in order to eliminate months with loss or that didn't achieve profit.
Also, the value function returns a column table that contains the distinct values from the specified table or column (Monthname) 

Sales for Profitable Months = 
CALCULATE(
    [TotalSales],
    FILTER(
        VALUES('Calendar'[MonthName]),
        [Profit] > 0)
    )

Therefore, Sales for months with a loss would then be [Profit] < 0 which is equivalent to negative value
