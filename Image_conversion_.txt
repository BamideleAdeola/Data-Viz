#Converting #Image #URL to Image and Changing the #image #size in #Power #BI

Have you ever wondered how to convert your image url into an image in a table visuals of #Power #BI?
Just change the data category of the url to image url under column tools tab and that solves the issue. 
However, February 2022 update of Power BI gives flexibility as to how to change the size of the image width and Height. 
Hence, you don't need to manually adjust image size. I decided to change my size to Height 100px and width 100px.

I got the data from data.world.
