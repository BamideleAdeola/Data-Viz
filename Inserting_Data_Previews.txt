#How to insert Data Preview in #Power #Query.

A question popped up from my last post on how to insert data preview and I thought to share this here. 
Data preview helps to see hidden overview on your data before doing any analysis. 
There are several data preview items I love to use; Column Profile, Column Distribution and Column quality.
Funny enough most people donâ€™t really use these features. This is because they are deactivated by default.
The whole reason why these features exist is to make your life easier working with Power Query.
Also note that the data is a fictitious data.
