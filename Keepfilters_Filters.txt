#KeepFilters & #Filter in #Calculate #DAX #Function 

Calculate and Calculatetable are very important #Dax functions that helps to write calculations which remove or 
add filters or even modify relationship paths. This is possible by passing in filter arguments, 
which are either Boolean expressions, table expressions, or special filter functions. 

I would be looking at the Table and Boolean expression here.

My intention here is to calculate Small Box Container sales by using a table expression: (FILTER)

Small Box Container Sales Filter = 
CALCULATE(
    [Sales],
    FILTER(Orders, 'Orders'[Product Container] = "Small Box")
)


While the above returned a correct value, it would have been better achieved much more efficiently using a Boolean expression. (KEEPFILTERS)

Small Box Container Sales Keepfilters = 
CALCULATE(
    [Sales],
    KEEPFILTERS('Orders'[Product Container] = "Small Box")
)

Note the following: 
1. That it returned the correct result does not mean it is the efficient measure.
2. Try as much as possible to pass filter arguments as Boolean expressions for best performance.
3. For more complex filter requirements, use table expressions.
4. Using the default filter in Calculate and placing it in a product container table returns Small Box sales across the containers.
