#On-Object interactions with #visualization in #PowerBI

Have you ever tried the On-object interaction on PowerBI yet? 
Super cool update from Microsoft. Just like our native office #formatting visuals on visuals themselves. 
- change visualization type
- format text
- add fields, etc.

I am excited at this updated but you might have to turn on the preview features and restart your powerbi desktop to make it work.
