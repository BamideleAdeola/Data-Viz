Percent Total using #ALL and #ALLSELECTED #DAX #Function

Depending on your business use case, ALL and ALLSELECTED could be used as a percent total measure. 
However, it is paramount one knows how they both work in a table. 

Since #ALL Return the table or column with filters removed, irrespective of the filter context, the measure still takes the exact total to divide. 
From the screenshot, filtering for just Central and East returns the Central and East against the total or ground total.

However, if the business objective is to find the percentage based on what is selected (Central and East), then #ALLSELLECTED should be used in this instance.
