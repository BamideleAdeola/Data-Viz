Percent Total using #ALLEXCEPT #DAX #Function

Initially, the ALLEXCEPT Function measure seems to return a similar value with the total sales measure. 
Hmmm. One can only tell with a practical table and context understanding. 
For #ALLExcept, all context filters in the table are removed except those that are applied to the chosen columns. 
And the chosen column in this quick demo is the Product Category.
This is a handy shortcut for cases where you wish to remove the filters from many, but not all, of the columns in a table.
