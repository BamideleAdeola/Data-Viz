#Power #Automate and #Power #BI

As a data specialist, please do not forget to automate your process. 
A client used Microsoft Form to create a survey and request that it be automated as an excel file on #OneDrive for #Business. 
What I did: 
1. Export the data and save it on a OneDrive
2. Create a Power Automate flow to update the rows anytime there is a response on the form
3. Get Response id
4. Add a row into the saved table (excel) - You can select only useful fields from the response id.
5. Test the flow and save it.
