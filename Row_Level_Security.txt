#Setting up #Row-Level #Security (RLS) in #PowerBI Desktop (#Enhance row-Level security) 

Do you intend to restrict data access for given users? 
I have used it on several occasions to filter who sees what considering I have like 6 companies within a group.
Howeevr, you need to note the following:
1. You can configure RLS for data models imported into Power BI with Power BI Desktop. 
2. You can also configure RLS on datasets that are using DirectQuery, such as SQL Server. 
3. For Analysis Services or Azure Analysis Services lives connections, you configure Row-level security in the model, not in Power BI Desktop. 
4. The security option will not show up for live connection datasets.

In February 2022 update of powerbi, it became more user friendly as you do not need to write any DAX formular anymore.
Just enable the features (#Enhance row-Level security) from Options and settings.

#USE #CASE
a. Willing to have a row-level security for regional sales manager. 
b. You can only be a sales manager for just one region at a time.
c. Also, I intend building a single report which will be shared to all sales managers with a row-level security that enables each managers to see only their regional data.

What other business case do you use row-level security for?

Note: You will still have to set it up Power BI Service.
