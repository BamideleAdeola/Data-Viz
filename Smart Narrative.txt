#Smart #Narrative #technology (#ARE YOU SMART IN YOUR #NARRATIVES?)

If your intention is to give key takeaways, point out trends and allow end users understand your data, then Smart Narrative is your go-to technology.

All you have to do is create line chart(s) or bar chart(s), then select the smart narrative visual from the pool of charts present in #power #bi. 

A client reached out to me and asked that they needed to see the explanations behind a bar chart, and right there I knew the request would be achieved with smart narrative.  

Let me know if you have used this technology previously. 

Also note that the data is a fictitious data.
