#Calculating #Trailing 12 #Month (TTM)

One of the requests I get frequently from our #finance #clients is Trailing Twelve Month (TTM). 
Imagine you intend to look at a #company's past 12 years performance which is not tied to the compnay's Fiscal Year.
Of all the approaches to solving this issue, using DATESINPERIOD was my best approach. 
Please always try to use a #Date #Table when working with Time intelligence functions.

Trailing_12_Month = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total_Sales], 
    DATESINPERIOD(CalendarDate[Date], MAX(CalendarDate[Date]), -12, MONTH)
)

Note: You could use several ways (#DATESBETWEEN, etc) to achieve same result.  

I hope someone that needs this sees it, kindly #like, #share, #comment and #follow.
