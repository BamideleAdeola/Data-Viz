#Automatic #Export of #data from #Power BI to #CSV

Do you intend to export data for further analysis at every time of data refresh? 
R within #power #query can come handy here. 

Steps
1. Install R on your system 
2. Run R-Script to export the data.
3. Publish to power bi service
4. Set up privacy level within power bi service data source to public
5. Configure data gateway (personal gateway for local files)
6. Set up Schedule refresh

For me I am running the below R-Script:
write.csv(dataset, file = "C:/Users/User/Desktop/Data/PowerBI_Export/countriesdata.csv").
This contains the folder path of where to save the exported data and the intended name in csv.

NOTE: The exported #data only includes #power #query #cleaned or #transformed data not #DAX within power bi #desktop. 
Hence, you have pulled data from several sources, merged and transformed the data, you can export its transform state at regular interval.

Power automate can also be used to achieve this.
