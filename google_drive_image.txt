#Google #drive image in #Power #BI

Have you ever wondered how to display your #google drive image on a power BI table, then this post is for you. 
It is not so straight forward because Power BI expects a jpg, pjeg, svc, etc. 

Here are the steps: 
1. Grant access to the image so that anyone with the link can view the image. 
2. Copy the Url or the image id after d and before view from the url you copied. 
3. Add the image id to https://drive.google.com/uc?id=
4. Create a table in powerbi and convert data category to Image url.

How will you solve this issue should you intend to pull your image to power bi?
