#Summing Groups of Every #N #Values in a #Row in #Excel

As a data specialist, I still love #Excel.  Summing a group of N row can be resolved with #OFFSET #Function. I have a dataset with 120 rows of data and the challenge was to sum it up in 10 consecutive rows. 
You don't have to do it manually. Using SUM, OFFSET, ROW function can do the trick.
